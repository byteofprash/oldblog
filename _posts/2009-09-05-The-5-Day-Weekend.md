Its been an excellent weekend till date. 5-days holidays after the maddened periodicals(and the paper distribution(:() needn‚Äôt say),isn‚Äôt it awesome!?. The banks also declared a holiday today due to the demise of YSR, CM of andhra pradesh. From the little knowledge I had about him, I found him to be this well-educated-politician.(where in india can u find a Doctor in politics?). But effecient people don‚Äôt stay long i guess. ok, all those things apart. As, amma and appa were at home today, I got to plan this small drive to ‚Äúpoondi‚Äù, a place in the foothills of velingiri mountains(yeah,near dhyanalingam),a 35 km ride from coimbatore. And its a holiday with dad home,which implies i get a chance to drive the car. So we three left home by 3p.m (with me driving the car). The whole route was AMAZING!!, with full of green and small villages enroute. Fortunalety the climate was also soo obliging, with those cold breeze and drizzle. It took us 1 hr to reach the place, where you have this very old shivan temple. Well, myself and dad have this habit of having chai during the drive and with the climate being so germane, the chai along with the britannia biscuits tasted great. After the visit to the temple and few photo sessions we started back home and reached by 6 p.m. That was the end of the trip. Where do we go for the next weekend dad?  üòâ
